I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out an' out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving
Through the south
In an' out the valley

The music, dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving
Through the south
In an' out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky
And they stand there
One mile over we'll be there
And we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be back
And laughing too
Twenty four before my love
You'll see, I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving
Through the south
Even in the valley

In and around the lake, woh
Mountains come out of the sky
And they stand there
One mile over we'll be there
And we'll see you
Come again
Ten true summers we'll be back
And laughing too, oh, oh
Twenty four before my love
You'll see I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud
The eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind
The sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagles dancing wings
Create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land
Feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time
A thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears
We stand surrounded by a million years

'Ill be the roundabout
The words will make you out an out
Ill be the roundabout
The words will make you out an out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky
And they stand there
Twenty four before my love
I'll be there
(Feels like)

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out an' out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving
Through the south
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky
And they stand there
One mile over we'll be there
And we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be back
And laughing too
Twenty four before my love
You'll see I'll be there with you

There with you na, na, na
There with you na, na, na
There with you na, na, na
There with you na, na, na
There with you na, na, na
There with you na, na, na
There with you na, na, na
There with you na, na
