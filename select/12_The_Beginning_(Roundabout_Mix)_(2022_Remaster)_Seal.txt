The beginning

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Hold on to the love

The beginning saw existence of a chosen dream
But then came pain with energy
Striking on those she knew
Would uncover her lies

She felt she must destroy
Everything that we had prayed for
So she sent shameful claim in her lies
She wants us to be what's going on in her mind

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Hold on to the love

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Na, na, na, na
Hold on to the love
We are smiling

She wants us to be what's going on in her mind
If she is to take over she must prevent unity
But oh how cold her life must be

She knows she must destroy
Everything that we had prayed for
So here comes shameful claim in her lies
But we are smiling again

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Hold on to the love

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Smilin' again
Hold on to the love
So hard for me to try and tell
How I'm feelin'

Na, na, na, na
Hold on
Na, na, na, na
Hold on

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Hold on
Na, na, na, na
Hold on
Hold on to the love

Hold on to the love

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Smilin' again
Hold on
So hard for me to try and tell
How I'm feelin'

Na, na, na, na
Hold on
Na, na, na, na
Hold on
Na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na
Hold on
Na, na, na, na
Hold on
Hold on to the love

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Hold on to the love

Music takes you round and round and
Round and round and round
Hold on to the love
Hold on to the love

Hold on
Hold on
Go round, go round
Hold on to the love
Hold on

Go round
Hold on
Go round, yeah
But hold on to the love

The music takes you round
It takes you round and round and round
But hold on to love
Hold on, hold on to love
Hold on, hold on to love

The music, the music, the music takes you round
The music, the music, the music takes you round
The music, the music, the music takes you round
The music, the music, the music takes you round
