So you made a u-turn at the roundabout
You didn't even look behind
Is there something we need to talk about?
Tell me why you changed your mind?

And I don't know what I said
But it stuck in your head
And now I guess you're seeing red
Ha, ha, ha

Now we're drivin' on a different road
Tell me where you wanna go
I'd like to know if you gonna kick me out
Cos baby it takes 2 tu tu to tango

I see the lights turn red
I shoulda stayed in bed
Now it's my turn to lose my head
Ha, ha, ha

(Won't you) make another u-turn at the roundabout
Ouh
Turn the music down so you can hear me shout
Ouh

We can make a deal
But let me take the wheel
Zigzags in the street
I'm back in the driver's seat

Cos baby it takes 2 tu tu to tango
Mamamake another u-turn at the roundabout
Mamamake another u-turn at the roundabout
Mamamake another u-turn
Mamamake another u-turn at the roundabout
My turn to drive till you kick me out
My turn to u-turn at the round, roundabout
