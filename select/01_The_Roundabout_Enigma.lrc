[00:30.29] Life is a wheel of changes
[00:40.62] But changes are life
[00:49.98] And someday we will have to say goodbye
[00:57.93] But our spirit will survive
[01:11.43] 
[01:51.28] Love is phasing, love is moving
[01:56.35] To the rhythm of your sight
[02:00.93] In the darkness I get closer
[02:05.47] To the crossing point of light
[02:20.47] 
[02:10.87] (Reason is lasting)
[02:15.85] (Passion is living)
[02:20.56] (And dying is teaching us)
[02:24.66] (How to live)
